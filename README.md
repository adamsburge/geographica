# Geographica
Welcome to Geographcia. Geographica is a quiz webapp designed to quiz and teach users about geography. The quiz covers 4 geographic regions (the Americas, Europe, Africa and Australasia) and asks 3 subject questions per region (one about borders, one about waters and one about mountains). The quiz also features a hint button which allows users to explore the world on a Google-maps-like interface custom built for the game. Throughout the game, the user learns fun facts about various regions around the world and is provided with feedback at the end of the game based on their final score.

You can visit the [live site here](https://adamsburge.github.io/geographica/).

# Features

## Basic Site Overview

The webapp is split into two html pages. The first page, the home page, serves solely as a landing page and to provide the user with the inspirational quote encouraging them to learn about Geography by playing the game. The second page, the game page, is where the interactive game begins. The user is asked a series of questions about various geographic regions and the webapp provides the user with feedback based on correct or incorrect answers. It also allows the user to open a hint modal box which provides the user with a custom Google-maps-like interface to explore the geography of the world and find the answers to the questions.

## Home Page

The home page presents the user with the title of the website, a quote from Kenneth C. Davis about the importance of Geography, 4 images of the various continental regions and a call to action which leads to a button that starts the game.

### Hover Effect

All the buttons throughout the site use a hover effect which places a shadow underneath the button. 

## Game Page
There are many different features on display on the game page. As the user progresses through the game, different content and buttons appear and disappear, a progress bar loads, and a total score is kept.

### Game Start
![Game Start Page](assets/images/game-start.png)
At the start of the game, the page loads the first question. The user is provided with 4 multiple-choice answer options. This question view provides the user with a hint button which opens a modal box containing a hint, a score label which adds 200 points for every correct answer, and a progress bar at the bottom of the page.

### Solution Display

When the user clicks on an answer, the solution section is loaded and either congratulates the user for their correct answer or offers condolences for getting the answer incorrect. Additionally, underneath the inital response, a fun fact is provided which relates to the question that was just asked.

### Progress Bar

The progress bar is split into two levels. The top level tells the user two things: 1.) the topic of the question they are on (borders, waters, or mountains) and 2.) which questions they have gotten correct or incorrect. The bottom level of the progress bar tells the user which continent the current question pertains to. Both levels are slowly displayed as the user progressed through the game.

### Final Score Display
